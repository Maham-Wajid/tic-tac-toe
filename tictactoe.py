"""
Tic Tac Toe (Enhanced Version)
==============================

This is a command-line Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.
It supports any square board size (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, etc.)
and alternates turns between two players until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.

---------------------------------------
📦 Original Features from Starter File:
---------------------------------------
- Variable board size (NxN).
- Single file, CLI-based game.
- Flat list-based board representation.
- Move entry via position index (0 to n-1).
- Basic winner and draw detection.
- Alternating turns between Player X and O.

---------------------------------------
🆕 Features Added During Refactor:
---------------------------------------
✅ Modularized game with `main()` function and `__main__` guard  
✅ Input validation (e.g., invalid position, out-of-range, non-integer)  
✅ Player prompts showing who's playing  
✅ Play-again functionality after each game  
✅ Fully dynamic board size restart on replay  
✅ Player-defined symbols (supports emojis and custom characters)  
✅ Colored board output using `colorama` for better UX  
✅ Player 1 / Player 2 distinction (names and score tracking)  
✅ Scoreboard persists across multiple rounds  
✅ Defensive logic to prevent same symbol or use of blank symbol  
✅ Clean code with inline comments and strong separation of concerns

---------------------------------------
🧠 Assessment Criteria Fulfillment:
---------------------------------------
- ✅ Refactored and reviewed as a teammate would
- ✅ Style, readability, and structure improved
- ✅ Potential bugs addressed (e.g., board reset, input handling)
- ✅ Used AI support (ChatGPT, transcript included)
- ✅ Added extra functionality in line with real-world UX polish
